# JavaScript Fetch API Revision

Welcome to the **JavaScript Fetch API Revision** repository, where we explore the power and simplicity of JavaScript's Fetch API through a practical mini-project. This project focuses on fetching data from the PokéAPI, a rich and well-documented database of Pokémon species.

The project allows users to input the name of any Pokémon into a search field. Upon submission, the app sends a request to the PokéAPI, retrieves the corresponding data, and dynamically displays the Pokémon's image on the web page. This project is a great way to understand how to work with APIs, manage asynchronous operations, and handle errors effectively in JavaScript.

Through this project, you'll gain a solid understanding of how to:
- Send HTTP requests to an API using JavaScript.
- Work with asynchronous operations using `async/await`.
- Manage and display data dynamically within a web application.
- Implement basic error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.

This repository serves as a valuable learning resource for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of JavaScript's Fetch API and its applications in real-world projects.
